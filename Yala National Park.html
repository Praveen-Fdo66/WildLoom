        <p class="anim">Are you planning a trip to Sri Lanka? Then a safari in Yala National Park is important. 
            Yala National Park straddles Sri Lanka's empty southeastern coastline, and the 1268-square-kilometer
            park is home to a rich array of dunes, forests, open plains, and lush lagoons, as well as a large diversity
            of wildlife; 44 mammal species (including elephants) and over 215 bird species to be exact! A visit to Yala
            National Park provides travelers with the opportunity to witness leopards and elephants in the wild. Yala 
            has one of the world's highest leopard concentrations, with an estimated 25 leopards roaming Block 1 alone.
            A safari in Yala is your chance to see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. The best chance 
            to see the elusive cats, while an elephant encounter is almost guaranteed. Which is astonishing in a country 
            the size of Sri Lanka. This essay will help you organize the ideal visit to Yala National Park. In addition 
            to providing context and history for your visit, we also provide you with all the insider information you need
            to organize the perfect trip, such as how to get there, where to stay, and suggestions to help you make the
            most of your safari. <a href="https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/yala-national-park-safari" target="_blank"><span class="citation">(thecommonwanderer.com)</span></a>

        <h2 class="anim">History of Yala National Park </h2>
    
        <p class="anim">Yala, Sri Lanka's most popular and second largest national park, has a long history of conservation 
            in the country's east, dating back to the early twentieth century when it was first established as 
            a wildlife refuge. The area was designated a national park in 1938 because it was home to a varied 
            array of flora and fauna, including numerous endangered species such as elephants, leopards, and a 
            diversity of bird species. The park suffered from poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking in the 
            1970s and 1980s, but conservation efforts by the Sri Lankan government and numerous non-governmental 
            groups helped to safeguard and restore the park's environment. The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami badly 
            affected the national park.Many humans have been carried away, affecting the park's natural charact
            eristics. Fortunately, the park has rebounded from this tragic tragedy and is now one of the most po
            pular and accessible locations in Sri Lanka and throughout the world for visitors looking to see el
            phants and leopards up close. The park is separated into five zones, each with its own distinct feat
            ures and animals. The most popular zones are 1 and 5, which are noted for their dense populations of
            wildlife, particularly leopards.  The park can be entered through a variety of gates, but the Palat
            upana entry is the most popular. This gate is located near Tissamaharama and is the most easily acce
            ssible by public transit. Not only is Yala National Park. <a href="https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/yala-national-park-safari" target="_blank"><span class="citation color">(thecommonwanderer.com)</span></a>
        </p><br><br>
        <p class="anim">It's a fantastic area to watch wildlife, but it's also rich
             in cultural history, with well-preserved ancient temples such as Sithulpahuwa and Magul
             Vihara located within the park. If you ask us, it's really great.</p>

        <h2 class="anim">What Animals will you see on a Yala National Park Safari </h2>
    
        <p class="anim">The leopard is the real star of the show. Yala National Park is one of the best sites in the world to
            witness these gorgeous animals in their natural habitat. They can be more elusive, but with a little 
            patience and a keen eye, you should be able to find one or two. Elephants, gracefully strolling around 
            the park, are another sight to behold, making a Yala National Park safari an excellent way to get up 
            close and personal with these gentle giants. Keep your camera handy because there are many other species 
            to see: lively monkeys tumbling through the trees, frightened deer hiding in the undergrowth, and massive 
            crocodiles lounging on the banks of rivers.
            <a href="https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/yala-national-park-safari" target="_blank"><span class="citation">(thecommonwanderer.com)</span></a>
        </p><br><br>
        <p class="anim">Bird lovers will be happy to learn that Yala National Park is home to over 200 bird species. During your tour
            , you will have numerous possibilities to observe birds, ranging from colorful peacocks to fearsome eagles. 
            With so much wildlife to see, remember to bring your binoculars and telephoto zoom lens.

        <h2 class="anim">When is the best time to visit Yala National Park </h2>
    
        <p class="anim">As we describe in our '39 things to know before visiting Sri Lanka' essay, the island has not one, 
            but two monsoon seasons each year, which affect separate sides of the island at different times of 
            the year. The dry season, which lasts from February to July, is truly the only time to visit Yala 
            National Park, as a shortage of water means lots of species to be observed around reservoirs. We 
            visited in November, just as the park reopened, and while it was lush with green from the northeastern 
            monsoon, we recommend a Yala National Park safari between February and July, when wildlife viewing 
            opportunities are better due to a lack of water</p><br><br>

        <p class="anim">Want to see a leopard? Between April and July, water levels are low, making leopards more active and visible. 
            However, we did see one during our November vacation. Bird enthusiasts may favor the months of November through 
            January, when there are many migratory birds to witness.
        </p> <br><br>

        <p class="anim">Finally, the park can get fairly crowded (and we mean crowded!) between December and April, so if you want a more 
           serene Yala National Park safari experience, go during the off-season. <a href="https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/yala-national-park-safari" target="_blank"><span class="citation">(thecommonwanderer.com)</span></a>
        <br><br>

        <p class="anim">Regardless of the season, schedule your safari for early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the animals are most active.</p><br><br><br>
    
        <h4 class="anim"><span class="citation note">NOTE</span> | The park is closed for a month between September and October for annual maintenance/drought prevention.
