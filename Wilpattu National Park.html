        <h2 class="anim">About Wilpattu National Park</h2>
    
        <p class="anim">The Wilpattu National Park (Sinhala: විල්පත්තු ජාතික වනෝද්‍යානය) is a national 
            park in Sri Lanka. The presence of "Willus" (natural lakes), which are natural, sand-rimmed 
            water basins or depressions that fill with rains, distinguishes this park from others. The 
            park is located in Sri Lanka's northwest coast lowland dry zone, 30 kilometers (19 miles) 
            west of Anuradhapura and 26 kilometers (16 miles) north of Puttalam. It is roughly 180 
            kilometers (110 miles) north of Colombo. The park covers 1,317 km2 (508 sq mi) (131,693 hectares) 
            and has elevations ranging from 0 to 152 meters (0 to 499 feet) above sea level. Wilpattu has 
            over one hundred and six lakes (Willu) and tanks distributed throughout it. Wilpattu National 
            Park is Sri Lanka's largest and one of its oldest. Wilpattu is globally famous for Leopard 
            (Panthera pardus kotiya) population. The Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust conducted 
            a remote camera survey in Wilpattu from July to October 2015, capturing photographs of forty-nine 
            individual leopards in the surveyed area, which had a core area density comparable to Yala National 
            Park's Block I and Horton Plains National Park</p><br>
            <p class="anim">
                The park was closed from December 1988 to March 16, 2003, due to security concerns related to the Sri 
                Lankan Civil War, before reopening to visitors sixteen years later. Currently, visitor access is limited 
                to around 25% of the park, with the remaining covered in deep forest or scrub. Popular visiting periods 
                range between the months of February and October, however there are a number of private ecotourism organizations that conduct safaris year-round.

<!-- HISTORY OF WILPATTU NATIONAL PARK -->
<div class="YALA sec-3">
    <section class="yala-top heading">
        <h2 class="anim">History of Wilpattu National Park</h2>
    
        <p class="anim">Wilpattu is located on Sri Lanka's west coast. The Wilpattu National Park continues 
            inland towards the historic city of Anuradhapura, located in the Cultural Triangle. The Park has 
            a somewhat dense dry zone forest mixed with a number of flood plain lakes banked with fine white 
            sand. It has an incredible variety of plants in vast stretches of forest with diverse animals.
           
        </p><br><br>
        <p class="anim">A topographical feature particular to this part of the island is the 
            abundance of villus or natural lake-like basins. All bar two of the villus within 
            the Park contain pure rainwater and support a vast range of resident and migratory water-birds.
        </p><br><br>
        <p class="anim">
            The Wilpattu National Park is rich in history and legend. According to certain discovered ancient 
            remains, Queen Kuweni lived in the area today known as Kalli Villu. Queen Kuweni is essentially 
            the mother of the Sinhalese race, as her marriage to Prince Vijaya (Sri Lanka's first ruler) produced 
            its people. Historical evidence also indicates that Prince Saliya, son of King Dutugemunu (161–137 BC), 
            lived in Wilpattu almost 2,000 years ago. Pomparippu, which borders the park, is also historically s
            ignificant since ancient urns have been excavated there. The remains of an old harbour may be found between 
            the coastal settlements of Palangaturai and Kollankanatte.Because of its rich history, Wildloom also provides 
            historical tours throughout the National Park, which may be scheduled upon request. Wilpattu was designated 
            a Sanctuary in 1905 and upgraded to National Park status in 1938. It is presently one of the oldest and most 
            significant protected areas in Sri Lanka. <a href="https://www.mahoora.com/national-parks-sri-lanka/popular-national-parks-sri-lanka/wilpattu-national-park-sri-lanka.html" target="_blank"><span class="citation color">(mahoora.com)</span></a>

        <h2 class="anim">When is the best time to visit Wilpattu National Park </h2>
    
        <p class="anim">The annual temperature in the Park is around 27°C and its annual rainfall is approximately 1,000 mm. 
            Though situated in the dry zone, the climate inside the Wilpattu National Park is very unlike that of the dry zone. 
            The period from September to December is known as the rainy season in Wilpattu with the north east monsoon falling 
            heavily. Inter-monsoonal rains come to Wilpattu between March and April. The period of drought in the Park extends 
            from May to early September. Thus the best time for wildlife safaris at the Wilpattu National Park is during the 
            months of February and October.</p><br><br>

        <p class="anim">This National Park can be visited throughout the year but for that optimal safari experience, 
            a visit during the months of February and October is recommended. <a href="https://www.mahoora.com/national-parks-sri-lanka/popular-national-parks-sri-lanka/wilpattu-national-park-sri-lanka.html" target="_blank"><span class="citation">(mahoora.com)</span>
